# Machine-Learning-Labs
### NOTICE: The following work is the original creation of Marko Tyhansky and is not permitted for use without consent of original author.
#### A collection of every lab and homework assignment I have worked on in my Machine Learning class. Meant to showcase Statistical ML skills in R including but not limited to:
#### Regression (linear, polynomial)
#### Classification (logistic regression, support vector machines).
#### Performance metrics (accuracy, precision)
#### Data preprocessing (scaling, normalization)
This work rewarded me with an A in Machine Learning and I couldn't be prouder of my efforts. R is without a doubt my favorite language and the work here certainly cemented that fact. The work is a bit unorganized but I've attached the assignment's instructions to highlight the accuracy to which I have followed said instructions.
